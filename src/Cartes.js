Hello,
\n My name is Pierre. Iâ€™m a Paris based full stack software engineer. I'm always open to new projects propositions !
\n I graduaded from a computer science and telecom school and very recently updated my knowledges at Le Reacteur, a fullstack Node.js/React bootcamp based in Paris.
\n I enjoy developing front-end as well as back-end, as long as there is problems to solve, ideas to find, and anything new to learn.
\n
\n Feel free to ask me any questions and my CV by email.

    \n>Travels
    \nIn 2012 I discovered the world on a 16.000km bicycle journey from Paris to Australia. I kept going later with two other travels on two wheels in Morocco and South America.

    I am a pianist, guitarist and I compose atmospheric electronic music, and I enjoy teaching any of this to beginners.
